# The truth will set you free

John Drake has recently resigned from the British secret service, for reasons unknown.

The following morning, he awakens in The Village to discover he is "Number Six".  All villagers have a number, and nobody knows who are the villagers and who are the warders.

In this tutorial, Number Six decides that in order to leave The Village, and to enable all the other prisoners to leave too, he must first find out who is Number One.  Surely this must be easy to figure out &mdash; Number One is the only villager who would need to lie about his number.

The story is in the tests, and the tutorial instructions are in the instructions file.
